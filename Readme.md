# Cricket alerts send to telegram using Python

### Project Introduction
Create a score alert notification mechanism to users in the telegram.

### Objective
You will implement the functionality which features regular updates of a cricket match on a Telegram group.

### Project Context
Cricket fans, raise your foam fingers if you have been looking for a quicker way to share scores and updates with your friends. Even if you arenâ€™t a sports enthusiast, think about the number of fans who are out there looking for an option like this on their phones. Sports websites do offer live scores on their page which is what the majority of the people follow to stay updated on live updates if they are not watching a match.


But the thing with these websites is that you have to keep staring at the page or refreshing it to get the latest score which can be quite unproductive if you are in the middle of important work. Moreover, every time you want to share the joy of a SIX or a wicket with your friend, you have to manually share it via a messaging app.


But now, you can build a better solution for the millions of sports fans (including yourself if you raised your foam finger) and even learn important concepts in that process.
